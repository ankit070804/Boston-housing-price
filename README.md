Boston House Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices  using the Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to accurately predict housing prices to aid in real estate analysis.

To achieve this goal, the project utilizes several key elements:

Dataset: The Boston Housing dataset.

Features: The model uses various features from the dataset to predict housing prices. Data 
preprocessing, including feature scaling with StandardScaler, is applied.

Modeling: A Linear Regression model is built.

Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R 
2 score.
